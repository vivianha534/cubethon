My first ever game! Developed alongside Brackey's how to build a video game tutorial series:

<h5> Development Process </h5>
This game was created using Unity and C#. I developed this game over 3 days while following along to Brackey's tutorial!

<h5> Future Improvements </h5>
Some future improvements include:
  Creating a help button during game level that will allow me to pull up instructions page, or go back to the main menu
    The help button should resume on the level that we left off on
  Creating more levels

<h5> Learning Experience </h5>
Overall, through this I learned the basic layout of Unity, how to create game Objects, how to add Scripts to game objects, 
and how to add UI to unity projects.
